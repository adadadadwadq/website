      <h1>Privacy Policy â€“ Roblox Watcher & Exploit Watcher</h1>
      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Roblox Watcher</strong> and <strong>Exploit Watcher</strong> handle and store information while operating as Discord moderation tools. By using the bots, you acknowledge and consent to the practices outlined here. If you do not agree, you must remove the bots from your server.</p>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 1, 2025</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Information We Collect & Store</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Discord User IDs:</strong> User IDs are permanently stored in our banlists when a user is identified as participating in <strong>condo games, exploit servers, or other prohibited activities</strong>. These IDs are used to enforce bans across servers that use the bots.</li>
        <li><strong>Server IDs and Names:</strong> Basic server identifiers and names are stored if a server has been flagged for prohibited activity. This helps prevent flagged communities from re-adding the bots after removal.</li>
        <li><strong>Moderation Logs:</strong> Records of actions (such as bans and detections) are kept to ensure consistent enforcement and transparency.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Purpose of Data Storage</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To maintain and enforce <strong>banlists</strong> that keep communities safe from users who engage in exploit activity or unsafe content.</li>
        <li>To prevent re-entry of banned users across multiple servers using the bots.</li>
        <li>To document moderation decisions and actions for accuracy and accountability.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User IDs and flagged server information</strong> are retained indefinitely as part of the banlist system unless successfully appealed.</li>
        <li>Other non-essential data (like temporary checks) is discarded once it is no longer needed for bot functionality.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Stored data is <strong>not sold, traded, or shared</strong> with outside organizations.</li>
        <li>Banlist information is used only for the internal functionality of Roblox Watcher and Exploit Watcher.</li>
        <li>In rare cases, data may be shared if legally required (e.g., responding to lawful requests).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Security</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We take reasonable precautions to protect stored banlist data from unauthorized access or misuse.</li>
        <li>Although protections are in place, no system can guarantee absolute security.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Appeals & User Rights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If you believe your account has been added to the banlist by mistake, you may submit an <strong>appeal request</strong> through the official Roblox Watcher Discord server.</li>
        <li>Successful appeals may result in the removal of your ID from the stored banlists.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Updates to This Policy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>This Privacy Policy may be revised to reflect changes in how the bots operate, security improvements, or compliance requirements.</li>
        <li>Significant changes will be communicated through bot announcements, documentation, or the Roblox Watcher community server.</li>
        <li>Continued use of the bots after updates indicates your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.</li>
      </ul>
