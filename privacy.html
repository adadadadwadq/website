      <h1>Privacy Policy – Roblox Watcher & Exploit Watcher</h1>
      <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Roblox Watcher</strong> and <strong>Exploit Watcher</strong> (collectively referred to as “the Bots”) collect, store, and use information. By installing or using the Bots, you acknowledge and agree to the practices outlined in this Policy. If you do not agree, you must remove the Bots from your server.</p>
      <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 02/10/25</p>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>To provide moderation services, the Bots collect and retain limited Discord-related information, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Data:</strong> Discord User IDs permanently stored in banlists when a user is identified as participating in exploit servers, condo games, or other prohibited activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Server Data:</strong> Server IDs and server names stored when a server is flagged for prohibited activity, preventing re-addition of the Bots after removal.</li>
        <li><strong>Moderation Records:</strong> Logs of actions (e.g., bans and detections) retained to ensure consistent enforcement and accountability.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Purpose of Data Collection</h2>
      <p>The data collected by the Bots is used exclusively for moderation purposes, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enforcing cross-server banlists against users engaged in harmful activity.</li>
        <li>Preventing banned communities or users from re-adding the Bots.</li>
        <li>Maintaining transparent and accurate records of enforcement actions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Data is never used for advertising, profiling, or unrelated purposes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>User IDs and flagged server information are retained indefinitely unless successfully appealed.</li>
        <li>Temporary or non-essential data is discarded once no longer required for functionality.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Collected data is <strong>not sold, traded, or shared</strong> with external organizations.</li>
        <li>Banlist and moderation records are used solely within the Bots’ internal systems.</li>
        <li>Data may only be disclosed if legally required (e.g., compliance with lawful requests).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Security</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We implement reasonable measures to protect stored data against unauthorized access or misuse.</li>
        <li>No system can guarantee absolute security, and we cannot be held responsible for breaches beyond our control.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Appeals & User Rights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Users who believe they have been added to a banlist in error may submit an <strong>appeal</strong> through the official Roblox Watcher Discord server.</li>
        <li>Successful appeals may result in removal of User IDs or Server data from the banlists.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Updates to This Policy</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Policy may be revised to reflect changes in features, compliance requirements, or data practices. Continued use of the Bots after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Policy. Notice of significant updates will be provided through official bot announcements or community channels.</p>
